# What is insulin resistance?

Insulin Resistance. Metabolic Syndrome. Syndrome X. Pre-diabetes. What we're talking about in layman's terms is a condition where your body doesn't process sugar very well. 

You eat something high in sugar -- candy, rice, fries, bread, or cereal, for example. Your blood sugar spikes. So, to deliver this sugary energy to your cells where it can be used to power your bodily functions, your pancreas releases insulin. Insulin acts as an escort, guiding the sugar to your cells and metaphorically, "knocking on the door." 

Unfortunately, if your cells are insulin resistant, most of them won't open the door. So, your pancreas, sensing the high levels of sugar still in your blood stream, pushes itself to create and release even more insulin. 

Doesn't help. Your cells still won't answer. So, what happens to all this sugar? Unfortunately, your body turns it to fat and deposits it directly onto your midsection and over time, you begin to take on an apple shape. 

Unfortunately being round in the middle isn't the only negative consequence. Left untreated, the insulin resistant may suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, poly-cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), liver & kidney problems, obesity, gestational diabetes, along with a whole slew of more minor but annoying issues like facial hair, darkening skin, hair loss, and more.

Sounds depressing. But with understanding and effort, you can manage insulin resistance and avoid or rid yourself of its negative consequences.
